This folder will hold all the notes and information for the final CSP project according to the AP guidlines
It should also contain notes that will help with the creation of the project and will ensure the project meets all criteria


Criteria:
    Input
        Can be from user, external device, online data, or a file
    List/Collection type
        Must help the program complete it's purpose and make the program easier to develop
    Function/Procedure
        Must be student developed and have at least one parameter
        Must include sequencing selection and iteration inside of it
            Essentially a for loop, if/else trees, and encorporate a list
    Output
        Must contain output changed based on the data/user input





Some ideas:
    Integration and other calc functions (basically make a calculator)
        Includes input, function, and output easily
            User input(what they want to do and what they want to do to it)
        Struggling to come up with a way to incorporate lists

    Boolean Game (to help future students with understanding boolean equations)
        Includes input, function, output, and Lists easily
        Would take a while to get it to a functioning level and even longer to be user friendly

    Some game (something to do with turtle and it's space, idk movement too ig)
        Really easy to include all the requirements but annoying to come up with an idea
        Feels like a cop-out





Will begin with getting the "barebones" of each idea, and then decide which one will be easiest to include all criteria while still giving the satisfaction of a "completed project"






....Scratch that, already made it too far in the boolean game


Boolean_Practice.py will contain all further edits
Has function with 1+parameter, sequencing and selection
    create_bool_string(bool)
    get_const(object)
    get_bool_snip(bool, bool)
